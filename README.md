# 👋 Hi, I'm Chinmay Purohit

🎓 I'm an undergraduate student in the **Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay**.

🔬 My academic interests lie in the areas of **Control Systems** and **Robotics**, where I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems interact with the physical world.

🏋️‍♂️ Outside of academics, I'm a **fitness enthusiast** who believes in staying active and balanced — both mentally and physically.

🧠 I love solving problems — whether it's tuning a control loop, debugging a robot, or cracking a tricky algorithm.
